CyberSHE is a comprehensive and user-friendly AI-based solution dedicated to safeguarding women against cyber violence. The project aims to provide a single, accessible solution that can address the multifaceted aspects of women's privacy and security in cyberspace.

Key highlights of CyberSHE includes:

Image protection: CyberSHE can utilize AI techniques such as machine learning models, and leverage already Microsoft existing technology/features such as reverse image search and MS photo DNA to protect women from the misuse and unauthorized distribution of their images and videos.

Filtering inappropriate contents/messages/comments: CyberSHE can integrate advanced content filtering algorithms that identify and block inappropriate and harmful content, including hate speech, threats, and other forms of digital harassment.

Access to support services: CyberSHE can go beyond prevention and can provide immediate access to esstential support services. Users can easily connect with professional counselors, legal experts, and relevant authorities using generative AI bots and natural language processing (NLP) .By this feature individuals affected by cyber violence can recieve necessary assistance, guidance, and protection.

By bridging the gap between technology and protection this project aims to create a safe online environment where women and girls can express themselves without fear.
